*Examples for Tapper frontend commands*

=head1 Create and bind a queue dedicated to a host

We want to use a host "calcium" dedicated for several testruns.

For this we create a dedicated queue that we schedule our testruns in
and bind that queue to the host "calcium".

=head2 Check host "calcium"

  $ tapper host-list | grep calcium
          16 | calcium

So we know ID is 16.

=head2 What runs currently on "Calcium"

  $ tapper host-list --name calcium
  16 | calcium |      active |    testrun 49028 |                kvm | xen-3.4-testing-64 | xen-4.0-testing-64 |    xen-unstable-64 |      kernel_reboot |  Kernel-benchmarks |        kernel_osrc |        autoinstall

=head2 Create dedicated queue "slbench-perl"

Show existing viewes to get overview af existing queues:

  $ tapper queue-list

Create new queue:

  $ tapper queue-new --name slbench-perl --priority 300

Activate queue:

  $ tapper queue-update --name slbench-perl --active

=head2 Bind queue to host

We want to connect the queue "slbench-perl" to the host "calcium".

Host binding is a property of the Host.

With this command we delete all existing bound queues (delqueue with
empty list) and bind it to the wanted queue (delqueue happens before
addqueue):

  $ tapper host-update --id 16 --delboundqueue="" --addboundqueue slbench-perl
  16 | calcium | active | in use | slbench-perl

=head2 If urgent we free host from currently running testrun

You can either wait until currently running workload finishes, or you
can hardly finish it:

  $ tapper host-update --id 16

Check that it is free:

  $ tapper host-list --name calcium
  16 | calcium |      active |             free | slbench-perl
